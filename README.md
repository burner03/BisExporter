Just a janky AI coded addon for Ascension WoW used for exporting out your gearsets to the website Bisbeard.com

I just made this cause I wanted it, use it if you want, fork it or steal it i dont care.

type /bis to open it up. I think you can figure it out from there.

folder name in addons should be BisExporter (remove the -main but you probably already know this..)
